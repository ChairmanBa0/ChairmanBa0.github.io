Hello, welcome to my personal webpage. I am a fourth year student in the economics PhD program at the University of California Santa Barbara. I'm interested in Environmental and Resource Economics, broadly. In particular, my current work focuses on the regulation of non-point source pollution using group-based policies. I also like to think about the effects that environmental policies have on innovation in green technologies.

When I am not busy doing research, I have an internal battle over whether I should go outside and be active or stay inside and be a potato. When I do happen to venture outdoors, I enjoy hiking nearby trails, taking sunset beach walks with the dog, or playing basketball (when there's no pandemic). I also consider myself a big foodie and since I am on a grad student budget, this inevitably means I am doing a lot of cooking!
