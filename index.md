Hello, welcome to my personal webpage. I am a sixth year PhD Candidate with the economics department at the University of California Santa Barbara. I'm interested in environmental and resource economics, broadly. In particular, my current work focuses on the regulation of non-point source pollution using group-based policies. My primary research agenda involves acheiving environmental goals at least cost; for instance, a recent project that I am working on involves designing payment for ecosystem service contracts that involves risk-based compensation payments which can end up saving the regulator money for acheiving some benchmark outcome.

When I am not busy doing research, I have an internal battle over whether I should go outside and be active or stay inside and be a potato. When I do happen to venture outdoors, I enjoy hiking nearby trails, taking sunset beach walks with the dog, or playing basketball (when there's no pandemic). I also consider myself a big foodie and since I am on a grad student budget, this inevitably means I am doing a lot of cooking!
