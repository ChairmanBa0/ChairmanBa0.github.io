#### <u>How Effective is an Ambient Tax-Subsidy in Addressing Non-point Source Pollution? A Case of the Florida Everglades</u>
*This study attempts to explore the eectiveness of an ambient tax-subsidy in addressing non-point source pollution problems. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of the policy at inducing abatement as opposed to the cost effectiveness though insights regarding the latter may be found from this paper. I study the Everglades Forever Act which, among other things, imposed an ambient tax-subsidy on farmers. I use a simple two-way fixed effects model with results that are consistent with the narrative that the policy was rather ineffective at inducing abatement. This result is preliminary and there are many problems with it still as well as how to interpret it.*
