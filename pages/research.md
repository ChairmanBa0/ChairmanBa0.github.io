#### <u>How Effective is an Ambient Tax-Subsidy in Addressing Non-point Source Pollution? A Case of the Florida Everglades</u>
*This study attempts to explore the eectiveness of an ambient tax-subsidy in addressing non-point source pollution problems. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of the policy at inducing abatement as opposed to the cost effectiveness though insights regarding the latter may be found from this paper. I study the Everglades Forever Act which, among other things, imposed an ambient tax-subsidy on farmers. I use a simple two-way fixed effects model with results that are consistent with the narrative that the policy was rather ineffective at inducing abatement. This result is preliminary and there are many problems with it still as well as how to interpret it.*

#### <u>Non-point Source Pollution and Ambient Taxes: Free Riding Incentives and Sequential Play</u>
*Ambient taxes oer a promising alternative to ameliorate the problem of non-point source pollution. Such taxes can induce polluters to collectively meet the pollution standard at least cost under certain settings. But in other possibly more realistic settings, it may achieve the pollution standard at higher than least cost if not at highest cost. This result is due to the presence of free-riding incentives and I show in this paper the conditions in which uncertainty about rm types may lead to incorrectly setting the uniform ambient tax rate which then creates free-riding incentives. I also show how the Nash and Sub-game Perfect Nash equilibria diverge in such cases. The main result is that the SPNE is unique, regardless of the value for t and produces a compliance outcome but at the higher than least cost.*

#### <u>Highway infrastructure and safety implications of AV technology in the motor carrier industry</u>
*This study explores the infrastructure investments needed to support the adoption of autonomous vehicles and provides potential safety benefits from AV technologies as a possible motivation for such investments. We assume that the motor carrier industry will be (one of) the first adopter(s) of such technologies, and therefore is the focus of this study. Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection decision trees are estimated to examine the effect of AV technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV tasks require readable lane markings to capitalize on potential safety benefits.*
