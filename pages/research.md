#### <u>Command-Control versus Market Incentive Policies for Non-point Source Pollution</u>
* This paper aims to compare the cost-effectiveness between command-control and market instruments in addressing non-point source pollution. Non-point source pollution (NPSP) is notoriously difficult to regulate as it is extremely difficult to observe and estimate individual level discharge. There is a dearth of observational studies on the cost effectiveness of NPSP policies because the answer requires the study of how individual polluters respond to pecuniary incentives to abate. I exploit a policy setting where agricultural runoff is in fact, a point source pollution but is regulated as if it were NPSP which allows the study of abatement behavior in what is typically a NPSP setting. In this context, command-control comes in the form of mandatory best management practices (BMPs) which are a set of verifiable pollution reducing projects/procedures that do not offer firms flexibility in abatement choices. Market incentives can offer a much higher degree of flexibility and thus lower compliance costs and in this context, they come in the form of ambient mechanisms (AMMs). AMMs impose uniform tax (or subsidy) to all firms based on aggregate emissions and such approaches are theoretically appealing but have rarely been applied in practice and thus relatively little is known about them. I study a program called the Florida Everglades Forever Act intended to reduce phosphorus runoffs from entering the sensitive Everglades. The program consists of both a command-control component as well as a market incentive component. I develop a new dataset with farm level discharge and subsidies for pollution reduction to estimate a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for the average farm. Using the estimated MAC curve, I simulate the costs under AMM and compare that with both data-estimated and engineer-estimated costs under BMPs. I find that to achieve the same benchmark pollution outcome, AMM could be about 1/6 the cost under BMPs.*

#### <u>Non-point Source Pollution and Ambient Taxes: Free Riding Incentives and Sequential Play</u>
*Ambient taxes o
er a promising alternative to ameliorate the problem of non-point source pollution. Such taxes can induce polluters to collectively meet the pollution standard at least cost under certain settings. But in other possibly more realistic settings, it may achieve the pollution standard at higher than least cost if not at highest cost. This result is due to the presence of free-riding incentives and I show in this paper the conditions in which uncertainty about rm types may lead to incorrectly setting the uniform ambient tax rate which then creates free-riding incentives. I also show how the Nash and Sub-game Perfect Nash equilibria diverge in such cases. The main result is that the SPNE is unique, regardless of the value for t and produces a compliance outcome but at the higher than least cost.*

#### <u>Highway infrastructure and safety implications of AV technology in the motor carrier industry</u>
*This study explores the infrastructure investments needed to support the adoption of autonomous vehicles and provides potential safety benefits from AV technologies as a possible motivation for such investments. We assume that the motor carrier industry will be (one of) the first adopter(s) of such technologies, and therefore is the focus of this study. Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection decision trees are estimated to examine the effect of AV technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV tasks require readable lane markings to capitalize on potential safety benefits.*
