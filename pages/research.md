#### <u>How Effective is an Ambient Tax-Subsidy in Addressing Non-point Source Pollution? A Case of the Florida Everglades</u>
*This paper studies the effectiveness of the Everglades Forever Act (EFA) in reducing phosphorus loads. Specifically, I investigate what happened under the EFA which then allows me to uncover what would an optimal standard ambient subsidy mechanism look like for this setting. I use the two-step difference GMM estimator (Arellano-Bond) to show that the tax credits did, on average, reduce farms' runoffs. Using the Arellano-Bond estimates, I am able uncover the average marginal profit curve with respect to pollution allowing me to calculate the optimal ambient subsidy rates for different levels of ambient pollution targets. Further, I am able to estimate the counterfactual outcome of only implementing the mandatory BMPs to gauge the effectiveness of mandatory BMP policy. The findings suggest that an ambient subsidy rate of \$21.01 could have achieved the regulators ambient pollution target instead of relying on the EFA. Lastly, previous studies' findings on BMP effectiveness in the Everglades Agricultural Area are significantly biased upwards due to ignoring the incentive tax credit program.*

#### <u>Non-point Source Pollution and Ambient Taxes: Free Riding Incentives and Sequential Play</u>
*Ambient taxes oer a promising alternative to ameliorate the problem of non-point source pollution. Such taxes can induce polluters to collectively meet the pollution standard at least cost under certain settings. But in other possibly more realistic settings, it may achieve the pollution standard at higher than least cost if not at highest cost. This result is due to the presence of free-riding incentives and I show in this paper the conditions in which uncertainty about rm types may lead to incorrectly setting the uniform ambient tax rate which then creates free-riding incentives. I also show how the Nash and Sub-game Perfect Nash equilibria diverge in such cases. The main result is that the SPNE is unique, regardless of the value for t and produces a compliance outcome but at the higher than least cost.*

#### <u>Highway infrastructure and safety implications of AV technology in the motor carrier industry</u>
*This study explores the infrastructure investments needed to support the adoption of autonomous vehicles and provides potential safety benefits from AV technologies as a possible motivation for such investments. We assume that the motor carrier industry will be (one of) the first adopter(s) of such technologies, and therefore is the focus of this study. Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection decision trees are estimated to examine the effect of AV technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV tasks require readable lane markings to capitalize on potential safety benefits.*
